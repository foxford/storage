# API

- **Set APIs** are convenient way to retrieve content, clients donâ€™t need to perform any additional steps, they just follow redirect (default behavior for clients like browsers).
    - **Set API** is used to access content by its **location in underlying backend**.
- With **Sign API** clients may perform **update and delete actions** along with read action. Note that the signed URI retrieved with the API has expiration time.
